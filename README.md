# MultiClassAnimalClassification

## Project Overview

MultiClassAnimalClassification is a machine learning project aimed at classifying images of animals into multiple categories using deep learning techniques. The project utilizes Keras and TensorFlow to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi-class image classification.

## Features

- Multi-class image classification for animal images
- Deep learning model built with Keras
- Trained model available for download
- Example code for inference and evaluation

## Download Model

Download the trained Keras model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QRFoasxALe73j3Ov4G1H2eNRnLBkRJZV/view?usp=sharing)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IshaBhole/MultiClassAnimalClassification.git
   cd MultiClassAnimalClassification
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Download the trained model from the link above and place it in the project directory.
2. Run the inference or evaluation scripts as provided in the project.

Example:
```python
# Example usage for loading the model and making predictions
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.models.load_model('path_to_downloaded_model.h5')
# Add your code for preprocessing and prediction
```

## Dataset
